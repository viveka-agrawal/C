# Programming Assignment 4 (pa4)

## Sparse.c
This client module will perform various operations on the matrices denoted in the input file using the Matrix ADT. 

## Matrix.h 
This header file contains all of the exported Matrix function declarations. 

## Matrix.c
This file is the Matrix module containing the Matrix type and associated operations.

## MatrixTest.c
This file contains test cases for the Matrix ADT (provided on course website). 

## List.h 
This header file contains all of the exported List function declarations. 

## List.c
This file is the List module containing the altered List type and associated operations.

## ListTest.c
This file contains test cases for the altered List ADT. Provided on course website; I modified it so it allocates dynamic memory instead of static memory. 

## Makefile
This is the Makefile for this assignment that creates the executable binary files Sparse, MatrixTest, and ListTest (provided on course website).
